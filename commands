    The hostkeys plugin manages the known_hosts file for your apps.

    You need those known_hosts files, when you want to open a SSH connection to a foreign host,
    such as when compiling the app and pulling in dependencies.

    After adding hostkeys to your Dokku host/app, they will automatically be baked in on the
    next time you compile your app.

    There are 2 types of keys:
    1.) Shared Keys
    Shared keys are valid for all your apps on the Dokku host. You may probably want to add
    some popular hosts in there such as BitBucket, GitHub or even your private VCS that is reachable.

    2.) App-Level Hostkeys
    App-Level Hostkeys may be needed for external dependencies which you licensed, or that reside
    on a different host

    You may as well want to have a look at the dokku-deployment-keys plugin on GitHub:
    http://github.com/cedricziel/dokku-deployment-keys

    Projects are kept separate because they each do one different thing.
